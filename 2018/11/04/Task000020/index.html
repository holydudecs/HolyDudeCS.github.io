<p>Question 1 – Analyze what ethical issues in marketing (mix) of Case 1 were complained by the customer as indicated in the above press release. Use the relevant information from the press release to support your analysis. (Also refer to Note on page 4: Ethical issues in marketing mix)</p>
<p>The marketing mix ethical issues pertain the decision making which suits the customer’s needs, business shareholders and suppliers. There are unethical issues like the selective adverts, price wars, deceptive marketing among others can have negative impacts on the relationships of the company (Andrews, and Shimp, 2017). </p>
<p>Ethics are defined as the theory of moral values systems that defines the right code of conduct. Ethical behaviors are considered as doing the right thing about society right standards. Marketing ethics is the process of applying market ethics in the process of marketing having the moral system operating and regulating the marketing mix.</p>
<p>Several factors are influencing the market decision making for customers, concerning purchasing products. Since consumer are exploited in the process of purchasing the product.</p>
<p>Ethical marketing issues consist of marketing mix issues such as Product Issues, Price issues, Place Issues, and Promotion Issues.</p>
<p>Promotion Issues contain elements such as Deceptive adverts: The customers are deceived or made to believe that something is true while in a real sense it’s a lie. For instance, Case 1: gives clients are given false information telemarketing officers claiming that he is selling Macau hotel conglomerate membership of $2,499, which after payment she receives confirmation of membership with company A which is not the actual hotel. Additionally, she was informed that the hotel had no records of her bookings which implies that she was deceived. Puffery; is the exaggeration of product claims and superiority conditions which is not true in reality. For instance, in Case one the client was informed that her offers comprise of 2 nights’ accommodation in a five-star hotel, the lunch buffet, return jetfoil tickets as well as 50 percent rates for discounts which was later revealed as false as she was informed to pay the extra amount for booking accommodation in another hotel</p>
<p>Pricing Issues; Bait and Switch: these are adverts where are given a product is priced very low for attracting customers as bait into the stores. While different products are sold at very high prices. For instance, in Case 1, the customers are offered meager prices for a lot of enjoyments and benefits. Accommodation in 5-star hotel, lunch buffet and return ticket including 50 percent discounts all at $2,499.</p>
<p>The product issues comprise of Harmful products: such as thalidomide disaster which took place in 1958 Westside, Failing to disclose information about product or services. For example, in case one the service hotline refused to disclose further information about her booking status despite repeated calls, and they only brush her off with information of all sorts. Like no information can be accessed on the computer.</p>

<p>Question 2 –   Use any four Customer Value Requirements to elaborate on how you would apply each of these requirements to avoid the above-identified customer’ complaints (Q1) to occur in your company.  State clearly which complaints are avoided, and it is expected all complaints should be addressed</p>
<p>Customer segment: understanding the important things for your customers and the opportunities you have for helping them. For instance, the problem of deceptive adverts which was used by the Macau hotel whereby the customers are deceived with false booking including benefits like lunch buffet, air ticket which in the real sense were, false.</p>
<p>Understanding your value propositions: the supplier should ask himself what value the customer gets through the use of your services or products, inclusive of the time spent while purchasing and using the products. That value will help countering the problem of bait price where the customer is offered $2499 for membership accompanied by the benefits like buffet lunch services and air ticket which the customer never realized as the company failed to offer the services after the customer made payment.</p>
<p>Customer Relationships: establishing the customer relations in some ways such as through offering personal assistance to the customer by customer service personnel team, who are handling inquiries as well as the complaints from the customers, through the community and hotel forums. That customer values will enable solve the problem of a product such as failing to give the client the full information about the products when the customer made several inquiries she was brushed off, which is not a proper customer care service that can maintain better customer relations</p>
<p>Key Resources: The hotel has the staffs among the key resources as well as the website, who are responsible for sourcing the providers of accommodations, creation and updating the online profiles about those who have booked the accommodation as well as the providers of accommodations. Verification for the payments, payment made to accommodation providers, As well as the customer services among other such activities. That customer value will help in the mitigation of the customer where the clients are brushed off claiming that no information about their payment is available in the computers (Payne, Frow, and Eggert, 2017).</p>

<p>60</p>
<p>Question 3 –   Use the two more mature levels of Ethical (Moral Character) Development Model to elaborate on how you would apply each of these levels to avoid the above-identified customer’ complaints (Q1).  State clearly which complaints are avoided, and it is expected all complaints should be addressed</p>
<p>The moral character model for development has comprised of the following elements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Current state: you have to ask yourself what is going on currently. That question will make you understand the conditions which the customer requires the products to meet, and the possible circumstance under which the client will require a given service or product. That concept might be applicable in the market to ensure that customers are getting the product or product that they have paid for on time to avoid inconveniencing them as they make complaints. For in our case above the client made several calls to no avail as they are informed that their names and amount they paid is not even visible in their computers (Payne, Frow, and Eggert, 2017).</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Desired end state: the service provider should ask him or herself, what the environment should be looking like, the question will help in the visualization of the desired condition. Like customer satisfaction which triggers consumer loyalty, in the long run. Customer relations will reduce the customer complaints such as puffery described above as customers are given exaggerated statements about a particular product. For instance the customer was told that only $2499 would be secure membership with Macau hotel conglomerated with benefits like 2 night accommodations, in one of the five star rated hotel, a lunch buffet, return ticket as well as 50 percent discounts which were in the real sense not true, since the customer waited in vain (Andrews, and Shimp, 2017). </li>
